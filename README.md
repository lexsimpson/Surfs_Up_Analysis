# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate weather data from Hawaii. We are opening an ice cream shop, however investors are concerned about rainy days and other weather circumstances. 
# Results
* During our analysis, we look at temperatures from both June and December. As we see from the screenshot below, Hawaii is a very even tempered state with the mean from both months being in the 70's. Almost every other state in the United States has a wider range of temperatures throughout the year.

* In order to get this statistical analysis, we needed a lot of data for our summary to be as accurate as possible. For December we had over 1,500 temperatures to look at, and for June 1,700.

# Summary
* One of the main issues our investors were worried about was rain, however our analysis does not include rainy days, only the temperatures. If I had to run another query it would be to assess the amount of rainy days in Hawaii.

* In this analysis we only assessed the temperatures for the months of June and December which is a great start, although I would like to look at more months in order to get a deeper analysis into the weather and possibly show some graphs for our visual learners.
